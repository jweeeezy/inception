## Notes

### Makefile<->Docker compose<->Dockerfile

#### Docker compose
- Docker compose migrated to Compose V2
(version 3. and older are called Compose V1)

``` docker compose version ```

- on school MacOS v2.2.3 is running (as of 01/12/24)

``` apt-cache policy service ```

- to check which versions are officially listed in packet manager

``` depends_on ```

- to explicitly make a container module dependant on another

- there is a difference between docker-compose and docker compose
- apparently no version statement is needed anymore (as of compose v2)
